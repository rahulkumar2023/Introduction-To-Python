# Project Overview

This repository contains multiple Python projects, each solving specific problems and organized into logical groups. Below is a breakdown of the projects and their associated files.

---

## **1. Random Number Validation and Profile Management**
### Files:
- **`random-number-processor.py`**
- **`profile-file-writer.py`**
- **`myspace_profiles.txt`**

### Description:
This project focuses on random number validation and user profile management.
- **`random-number-processor.py`**: Processes random integers by validating them and performing operations based on their differences.
- **`profile-file-writer.py`**: Manages user profiles by appending name, age, and favorite color data to a text file.
- **`myspace_profiles.txt`**: Stores the profiles created by the program.

## **2. Integer Analysis and Friendship Data Exploration**
### Files:
- **`odd-even-checker.py`**
- **`friendship-analyzer.py`**
- **`friendship.txt`**
- **`functions.py`**

### Description:
This project combines integer analysis and the exploration of friendship data.
- **`odd-even-checker.py`**: Checks if a list of integers consists entirely of odd or even numbers.
- **`friendship-analyzer.py`**: Processes friendship data from a text file, allowing users to explore relationships and connections.
- **`friendship.txt`**: Contains the friendship data for analysis.
- **`functions.py`**: Provides utility functions to support integer and friendship analysis.

## **3. Election Data Analysis**
### Files:
- **`election-data-analyzer.py`**
- **`functions2.py`**
- **`electionsData.txt`**

### Description:
This project enables users to analyze and interact with election data.
- **`election-data-analyzer.py`**: A menu-driven program that provides functionalities like finding maximum and minimum values, sorting data, and summarizing votes by province.
- **`functions2.py`**: Contains helper functions to process election data.
- **`electionsData.txt`**: A dataset containing election information such as population, votes, and polling stations.

## **4. Anagram Detection and Prime Number Analysis**
### Files:
- **`anagram-checker-prime.py`**
- **`prime-list-sorter.py`**
- **`functions3.py`**

### Description:
This project leverages prime numbers to detect anagrams and sort word-based data.
- **`anagram-checker-prime.py`**: Determines whether two uppercase words are anagrams using prime number mappings for letters.
- **`prime-list-sorter.py`**: Converts words into a list of prime numbers and sorts them using a recursive radix sort algorithm.
- **`functions3.py`**: Contains core utilities for mapping letters to primes, detecting anagrams, and sorting lists.

## **5. Hotel Management System and Stack Operations**
### Files:
- **`hotel-booking-system.py`**
- **`hotel_classes.py`**
- **`stack-reversal-tool.py`**
- **`Stack_class.py`**

### Description:
This project includes a hotel management simulation and stack manipulation tools.
- **`hotel-booking-system.py`**: Simulates hotel operations, such as booking rooms, adding services, and generating bills for guests.
- **`hotel_classes.py`**: Defines classes for different room types, guests, and services, encapsulating the logic for room availability and billing.
- **`stack-reversal-tool.py`**: Implements stack operations, allowing users to input a stack of numbers and reverse them.
- **`Stack_class.py`**: Provides a stack data structure with operations like push, pop, peek, and recursive reversal.

---

### **How to Run:**
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory of the project you want to explore.
3. Run the main script for the desired project (e.g., `python hotel-booking-system.py`).
4. Ensure all required dependency files are present in the same directory.
